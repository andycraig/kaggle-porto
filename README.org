Kaggle Porto -*- mode:org -*-

* Kaggle Porto Sugero competition 

** Requirements

Python package requirements are in code/requirements.txt.

** Use

All commands should be performed in code/.

Centre and scale data and set up stacking folds.
```
python preprocess.py
```

Models are: xgb, xbgStratified, nn, svm
Folds are: 0, ..., 4

Can train and produce submission file with:
```
python train.py config.yaml MODEL --sub
```

Fit hyperparameters.
```
python train.py config.yaml MODEL --hyperparams
```

Train each model for each fold.
```
python train.py config.yaml MODEL --fold FOLD
```

Stack.
```
python stack.py config.yaml 
```

** Notes

*** Test
**** TODO Make test files.
**** TODO Move file names into config YAML files.

Set up stacking. Need to stratify on pos/neg?

Make application of StandardScaler() a pre-processing step. Scaler needs to be consistent w.r.t. CV, stacking.

Set up CV for stratifying.

*** NN
Set up DNN.

*** XGBoost
Set up xgb.cv with sklearn.StratifiedKFolds. Done, but check what output is.
