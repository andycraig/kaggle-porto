* TODO Figure out why early_stopping_rounds=25 causes errors in xgbBagged but not xgb. :xgb:
* TODO Put early_stopping_rounds=25 back in to xgb's in hyperparams.yaml. (Currently breaks StratifiedBaggingClassifier.) :xgb:
* DONE Add target_encode.                                     :preprocessing:

* DONE Implement equivalent of BaggingClassifier, for which subsets can be specified, so can use stratified folds for 'bagged' XGB. :xgb:
