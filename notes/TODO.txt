Set up stacking. Need to stratify on pos/neg?

Scaler needs to be consistent w.r.t. CV, stacking.

Set up CV for stratifying.

Set up DNN.

Set up xgb.cv with sklearn.StratifiedKFolds. Done, but check what output is.

I had scoring: roc_auc as a hyperparameter for xgboost, but it wasn't used. Removed from hyperparams.yaml. Figure out if I should use it.
